# Tic-Tac-Toe
A tic-tac-toe project is a two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with X or O. The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
